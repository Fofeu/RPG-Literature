After reading Fate Core, I had the impression that the authors
described there a lot of great tools using too simple
examples. Reading the Fate System Toolkit intensified this
impression. The settings only confirmed it. The claim that you can
modify virtually anything in Fate and the game will survive that is
not taken out of the (wrong) hat. Rules can be broken on purpose, but
that's another matter.

The key to Fate is the creative use of its components in various
contexts. In simpler terms, assigning character elements to places,
objects, phenomena and events. It's not just the hero who needs to
have a strees track, skills and stunts.

It is best to show this with examples.

# We want a prisoner!

The heroes have just destroyed a hobgoblin patrol. Well armed,
organized. They had no right to be here, so far from their lands. Were
they mercenaries? Scouts? A team for special tasks? Maybe refugees
trying to break through human lands to escape a greater threat?

The prisoner would have to be interrogated.

The GM doesn't want the enemy to reveal plot details at this stage. He
expects the group to conduct a pseudo-investigation, going from NPC to
NPC for an hour to get key information. Therefore, none of the
defeated enemies will last long enough to be able to ask him even a
single question.

In Fate, the player decides what happens to the defeated opponent. If
he wants to, the NPC will only be stunned and will surely have enough
"hit points" left over to survive the muzzle. With these mechanics,
the Game Master has less opportunities to block access to information
than in mainstream games. For me, it's an opportunity, not a
disadvantage. Opportunity, because he learns to write adventures so as
to avoid the stupid going from A to B, from B to C, and so on until
the end of the alphabet.

# Twisted ankle

The knight gives chase after the goblin patrol, oblivious to the
danger. He runs down the rocky slope, hoping to catch the greenskins
before they reach the forest. Unfortunately, the player rolls a
critical failure on the run test - something bad must happen as a
consequence of the risk taken.

Just what?

* In D&D, the DM has little room to show off. He can take some
  dice and roll for damage (probably a d4, otherwise first level
  heroes would die en masse on such slopes). If he shows a greater
  dose of creativity, he can check if the knight hasn't broken potions
  or if the magic helmet hasn't bent. In other systems, you can also
  be triggered by the level of fatigue or some other status.
* And in Fate Core it is enough to give a consequence in the form of a
  [Sprained Ankle]{.mark .smallcaps}. Such an aspect will not stay
  with the hero for long (unless no one is able to treat the sprain -
  then it will stay with the character for some time), but as long as
  it is on the character sheet, the player can forget about catching
  up with anyone. During the fight, the enemy will certainly take
  advantage of this weakness and will maneuver in such a way that the
  knight must rest his weight on the injured leg. All this will cause
  a lot of problems for the team, but at the same time it will earn
  you some Fate Points.

The Fate System Toolkit takes you one step further. There is an option
to introduce effects assigned to aspects - although they are described
positively, nothing stands in the way of using this rule for negative
effects. These effects may involve spending (or receiving) a fate
point. A [Sprained Ankle]{.mark .smallcaps} does not fit here as an
example, because here the core rules are enough, but [Marked by
Horror]{.mark .smallcaps} (yes, an example from Earthdawn) gives you
more scope to show off - e.g. in exchange for a Fate Point, Horror can
enter a psychic duel with a character [Marked by Horror]{.mark
.smallcaps}. Another idea - after passing a Fate Point, Horror can use
his powers through the [Marked]{.mark .smallcaps} character (bypassing the issues of line
of sight, range, etc.).

A variant for the lazy - treat the rubble as a character, give it the
Tricky Terrain +3 skill, try to create an advantage in the form of the
[Sprained Ankle]{.mark .smallcaps} aspect, which will increase the
difficulty level when overcoming obstacles where a sprain can be
important. To get rid of this aspect, you'll need medical attention
(to beat the Trick Terrain roll).

## On the way through Mordor

The party wanders through a deadly wasteland. Water poisoned,
vegetation twisted, animals mutated, mostly rabid. Rocks sharp as
knives, bottomless abysses. Somewhere on the horizon looms a tower -
the entrance to the underground, where the undead dragon, the nemesis
of the heroes, hides. To be able to save the world, you must go
through this monstrous journey.

Will it really be that hard?

Playing the journey in game mechanics is sometimes some rolls for
fatigue, sometimes extra for random encounters. If the system has a
status mechanism (sick, tired, exhausted), it can also appear
there. But generally it's a binary business - a test of Endurance or
Survival and success or failure.

The One Ring has better mechanisms, cool solutions were proposed by
the author of [The Family of Our Time from Quentin
2016](https://www.quentinrpg.pl/?page_id=2674). However, these are
exceptions, the standard is different.

In this case, Fate introduces the Bronze Rule: everything in Fate can
be treated as a character (which is exactly how I treated rubble
above). So let this trip to the tower be a more serious Conflict, a
kind of epic fight, and not a mere formality. The Cursed Grounds will
have several aspects, such as [Dead Wastes]{.mark .smallcaps}, [Undead
Predators]{.mark .smallcaps}, [Toxins in the Air, Water and
Soil]{.mark .smallcaps}, and [Natural Labyrinth]{.mark
.smallcaps}. They will have the skills: **Hostile Weather** +4,
**Poisoning** +5, **Dangerous Terrain** +6, and **Taking Hope** +7. To
this you can throw in the *Road Traveled* stress track with three
checkboxes and add that the Cursed Grounds can take the same set of
consequences as player characters.

* The road to the dracolich dungeon will, of course, be a
  Conflict. Each round will be eight hours.
* The Cursed Grounds will be able to attack physically with
  **Poisoning** and **Dangerous Terrain**, mentally with **Taking
  Hope**. They will create an advantage with any of these skills.
* The group will perform group tests (highest skill value +1 for each
  character that has it higher than +0) with exactly the same rules:
  * Find shortcuts (Creating an Advantage),
  * Scare away predators (Attack),
  * Create accurate maps and travel records (Attack),
  * Magic to purify food and water (Creating an Advantage), etc.
* They will reach their goal when The Cursed Grounds concede - they will
  rather not want to be taken out (because that would certainly mean
  the extermination of the ghoul tribes living here and marking safe
  routes - that is, the "death" of the place in terms of mechanics),
  so it won't last indefinitely.

Alternatively, if players and the GM wanted individual tests, the
terrain could be treated as a group of minions supporting the boss.

# What is the philosophy behind it?

The above three examples are intended to show the general idea
followed by the authors of Fate. It's in the manual, but I'll
reiterate: Fate Core emphasizes the attributes of characters,
creatures they interact with, items, and places in the game world.

Fate Points ensure relative fairness, a balance between good and bad
karma (except for those few free points to start each session). The
artifact may give some bonuses, but it will show the strongest powers
only after "paying the fee" - so that the focus is on the hero, not
his equipment. This is to simulate (and simulates very well) scenes
from movies or books where a character succeeds in using a resource at
a crucial moment. He can fight with a lightsaber the whole campaign,
but the most important moment is when he rejects it because he doesn't
want to go to the dark side. He can carry a sword with a Pattern
Fragment at his side from the first session, but it will come in handy
when you need to quickly defeat the master swordsman from the Court of
Chaos.

The Fate Fractal only facilitates the implementation of these
assumptions. The difficult terrain will be difficult for half the
scenario, but it will affect the plot at that crucial moment when the
hero twists his ankle. Unstable AI will behave erratically just when
everything depends on its reliability. Rusty enemies will lock up
after the heroes defeat them, thus cutting off the pursuit.

Reifying facts and truths about the setting (or anything in game) with
the same, familiar rules used by players (Aspects, Skills,
Stunts) - This is the key to using the Bronze Rule in practice.
